# Light-Puzzle
A puzzle for your Philips Hue Smart Bulbs and iOS device.

## Connecting to Philips Hue Bulbs
To learn how to develop for the Hue Light bulb, I went to the [Hue developer site](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/). It lists 3 easy steps for getting started:
1. Test your bridge network by making sure you can control your lights with your iOS device
1. Find your bridge's IP address
1. Load the test app in your browser at:
https://\<bridge ip address\>/debug/clip.html

## Connecting an iOS app to a Philips Hue Bridge
A Hue developer account is needed to send commands to the bridge through an app and to access the [core concepts page](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/core-concepts/) on the developer site to learn how to connect to the bridge through an app.
